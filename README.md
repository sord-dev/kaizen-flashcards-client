## Stake Holders

### How can we help?

Kaizen Flashcards helps address the problem of effective, enjoyable, and accessible remote learning for students by providing a convenient and user-friendly tool for students to use in their revision.

With the implementation of a spaced repetition system, the app can optimize the time and effort students put into learning by helping them prioritize and focus on the cards they struggle with the most. This can lead to more efficient and effective learning, allowing students to retain information better and progress faster in their studies. 

The clear and logical design of the app, as noted by the students in the stakeholder statements, also contributes to a positive learning experience for users.

Overall, Kaizen Flashcards can help Crammer Education meet their goal of growing their customer base and staying one step ahead of the competition by providing a valuable and innovative tool for remote learning.
